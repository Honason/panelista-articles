## Västtrafik

Västtrafik is Sweden's second largest public transport agency. They are responsible for the public transport in western Sweden, and every day 400 000 customers choose to travel with their buses, trains, trams, and boats. In close cooperation with their partners, Västtrafik shape customer-centric public transport. The goal is to be the obvious choice when you travel. Västtrafik is evaluating Panelista as a way of involving their customers when they improve current and develop new services. So far two panels have been created; _Västtrafik Labs_ focused on the development of services and _Framtidens färjetrafik_ focused on the traffic over the river dividing the city of Gothenburg.

_We at Panelista interviewed Annelie Alm Bagå who is a service designer, and Samuel Nygren who is the product owner for the app Västtrafik To Go and their trip planning services_

### Why do you use Panelista?

**Annelie**: ~~We want to get in touch with different types of customers to bounce ideas with them.~~ We mainly use Panelista for exploratory research in early phases, but also for insight and opinions over time.

**Samuel**: Yes, it is important to get the customers' input beforee we design new features.

**Annelie**: It is also a bonus to be able to show that we include our customers and that we are an innovative company.

### How is it going?

**Samuel**: We are getting a lot of long and thought-through answers, suggestions, and comments. Not just thumb up or down. ~~The value you get compared to the effort you put in is amazing!~~

**Annelie**: The engagemant is very good so far. I do a lot of work with gathering customer data and insights, so I had a pretty clear picture of how it would work. One concern I had initially was how tto facilitate this type of online panl to get nice and constructive discussions. ~~I thought it would be hard, but it almost takes care of itself.~~

**Samuel**: Yes, I expected less engagement as we do not compensate the panlists for being part of the panel. I also did not think that so many panelists would answer our follow-up questions.

### How did you recruit panelists?

**Samuel**: We decided to contact people who had shown an interest in the past in some way. We invited people to the panel with a popup in our app, and by sending email invites to some customers we had been in touch with before. 

**Annelie**: The first panel was a general panel, and there we recruited people that we had easy access to. It seemed like a good idea to make it as easy as possible to get started, and then recruit more focused panels. Our second panel is for a specific study about traffic across a major river, so there we invited customers who travel with our ferries.

### What type of questions do you ask?

**Samuel**: One question was to test a few of our hypotheses around necessary information when something unexpected happens; _“How would you like to find out if something will affect your trip?”_. Another was to explore needs for possible subscription services; _“Should Västtrafik offer some kind of subscription? And if so, what is important?_". ~~We got a lot of things which we had not considered~~.

**Annelie**: We also asked a question where we linked to a prototype for a new feature in our app, so the questions can be quite different. Sometimes a lot of the panelists share the same needs, sometimes it varies a lot.

### Do you work with customer insights in any other way?

**Annelie**: Yes, we test prototypes, interview customers, send out surveys etc. Panelista's format with one question at the time generates longer and more nuanced answers compared to surveys. It is also nice for the customers to see the face of the person asking rather than just seeing the name of a large company like Västtrafik. Now you get to see the people behind the brand. 

**Samuel**: A video question on Panelista gives in-depth understanding. Not as deep as a hourlong interview with each person, but somewhere between a round of interviews and a survey. 

**Annelie**: It is very easy to send out a video question compared to finding a time where you can meet for an interview. I also like that ~~people answer when and where they want to~~ when using Panelista.

### What has been the best thing so far?

**Annelie**: The first question! The feeling when a lot of answers appeared almost immediately. It showed that the panel was engaged and that the customers wanted to contribute. We also got several hypotheses confirmed right away, so that we could act on them.

**Samuel**: ~~The best thing so far is how easy it is to actually send out a question.~~ If you know the topic you want to explore, it takes perhaps 30 minutes to come up with a good question and 20 minutes to record it and send it out. It is even easier for people who already have a roadmap where there are always new relevant topics to explore. 

### What has been the most difficult?

**Annelie**: To not look too serious in the video when focused! To find your own format that is relaxed but still professional. I would also like to see the panelists improve each others answers, I would love it if there were even more discussions and that the panelists took each others answers and ideas to the next level. We have seen some people do this, but we want more!

**Samuel**: Overall it is probably for us to take the insights and make them into design and tasks quickly enough when we find out what the customers need. Regarding Panelista, I agree that it is to make the video. The hard thing is to act natural and speak freely. To skip bullet points and scripts. ~~Just like a musician with chords where it gets better when you just listen and play along, but it requirees courage!~~

### What is it like working with Panelista and the Panelista team?

**Samuel**: Jag har aldrig hört talas om den här typen av tjänst innan. Ni gör något helt unikt. Produkten är väldigt smutt. Enkel, stilren, med bra överblick. Genomtänkt och lättarbetad.

**Annelie**: Det fungerar väldigt bra och var lätt att komma igång. Jag ser fram emot att se Panelista växa och få fler features, och vi har även en bra dialog med er kring saker som kan bli ännu bättre. T ex. hade det ibland varit trevligt att bara kunna skicka ut en snabbfråga med tumme upp/tumme ner. Roligt att vara igång och ~~folk blir väldigt peppade när de hör caset och inser hur lätt det är~~.

_Thank you, Annelie and Samuel!_ [_Read more about Panelista here_](https://panelista.com "Panelista").
