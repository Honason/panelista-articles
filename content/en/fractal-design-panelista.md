## Fractal Design

Fractal Design designs and builds computer cases, case fans, and PSUs, mostly intended for gaming- and hardware enthusiasts worldwide – selling their products in 45 countries and counting. While the actual design and engineering take place at the HQ in Göteborg, they also have offices in Dallas, Taipei, and China.
 
Fractal has always been a trailblazer. They started pushing the importance of the hardware design aspect at a time when no one else really seemed to care about it, and over the years their products have had quite an impact on the market. Constant product development is still at the very core of who they are, and an enormous amount of energy is spent on both perfecting their classic products to better suit an ever-changing world, and breaking new ground and challenging conventional wisdom – not least of all their own.

_With their first panel, we at Panelista have seen Fractal Design break the record for every single engagement metric on our customer insights platform. We knew that Fractal Design has a very strong fanbase, but we did not expect this. We interviewed Alexander Ernryd who is the CMO at Fractal Design._

### Why do you use Panelista?

**Alexander**: Our community is very important for our product development and brand. Fractal's customers have detailed knowledge as well as high demands and expectations on the products they buy. And we at Fractal Design strongly believe that ~~innovation happens together with our customers~~. Therefore, we want the opportunity to drill down into detailed customer input. This applies to both subjective opinions about design, color and shape, and more technical requirements linked to function and performance.

### How is it going?

**Alexander**: It has been overwhelming! We have gathered input from our customers in a variety of channels and formats, but never had such clear, strong, and manageable feedback as now. The quality has been at a high technical level, which makes it easier to draw conclusions, and in turn, take concrete actions.

The video format itself has been really rewarding and fits in with our quest to be personal to both our brand ambassadors and consumers, and we have marketed Panelista as ~~a direct channel into our product development department~~.

### Do you work with customer insights in any other way?

**Irma**: We also work with surveys. Getting a lot of answers is a benefit of surveys, and we will probably continue to supplement Panelista with surveys. Panelista feels much more personal though, and it is a lot of fun to have that direct customer contact.

**Martin**: Yes, even simple surveys can be incredibly rewarding. However, there is no interaction, and it becomes an administrative monster. We have also run live panels, and interviews that generated several features available on Wayke.se today. There is a chance that Panelista can outperform even live panels as some people are comfortable talking in front of a group and others are not. The involvement of the panelists, I suspect, has been so great because of the video format.

### What has been the most difficult?

**Martin**: It's about a bigger transition than just starting to use Panelista. ~~It is about actually becoming customer-centric~~ and understanding the customers better. It is far from obvious for companies to truly involve their customers, and a bigger change than one might think. It can change the whole way of thinking about the product, it can change the whole backlog. You have to really enjoy talking to the customers.

**Irma**: I can still find it a bit of a challenge to be in the video questions. With that said, I really wouldn't want to replace the video format, as you get so much back!

### What has been the best?

**Irma**: ~~There is very little effort involved to gain many new insights~~. We ask a question every other week, and it's fun when the answers start rolling in.

**Martin**: All of a sudden, we can get real-time answers from panelists and ask follow-up questions. ~~It is a magical thing when you can get a new idea and immediately check; Would our customers like this?~~

### What is it like working with Panelista and the Panelista team?

**Irma**: Panelista works really well! Nothing to complain about. It feels simple and logical. ~~Great that you quickly developed a new feature after my feedback~~. It was also very nice that you helped us get started, you made it happen right there and then. Otherwise, I would have postponed it a bit as I was nervous about recording the first video question.

**Martin**: Great product. Intuitive to work with. Keep it this simple! Your commitment is just the way we want it. You made sure we got started in the right way and continue to check-in frequently.

_Thank you, Alexander and Fractal Design!_ [_Read more about Panelista here_](https://panelista.com "Panelista").
